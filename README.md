#IDT Web Crawler#

For the IDT high school programming contest, we created an application that a user can use to parse through a website by simply providing the URL. The application creates a site map, noting HTTP status codes, linked pages, and input options on the page. The easy-to-use interface and navigation provides a good user experience.

To run, double click WebCrawler.jar. A user manual is available in Manual.pdf.
